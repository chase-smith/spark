This is Spark, the dual-themed static blog site generator.
I created it while working on my site, <a href="https://thinkingincode.ninja">thinkingincode.ninja</a>.
I've made it open source, so anyone is free to use it as they wish.
</p>
<p>
The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/chase-smith/spark">here</a>, and the files used to generate
this demo site <a href="https://github.com/chase-smith/spark/tree/master/example">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
This site is intended to demo what Spark creates, and how the site files are configured
(check out my site to see a live production site that's got lots of content).
I'll also post about substantial updates to Spark on this site, just to keep it slightly active.
</p>
<p>
As the CSS and such for this site is distributed with the repository, you're free to use it on your own site.
While it does look quite similar to my main site, I have changed it up a little bit (for example, I know not
everyone's going to want to use a monospace font like I did on my site, so I changed that up).
I spent quite a bit of time figuring out how to get content in the center of the screen, and make post footers look good
on mobile and such for my site, there's no sense in keeping that information hostage.
</p>
<p>
If you do decide to use Spark, let me know, and I'll check your site out! My contact information can be
found on the homepage of <a href="https://thinkingincode.ninja">thinkingincode.ninja</a>.
